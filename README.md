# Fermat-Primality-Test-Application
This project is a  simple web application that performs Fermat primality testing on user-inputted numbers, determining whether they are composite or  pass the Fermat Primality Tes . If the number passes the test, the application displays whether it is a prime or a pseudoprime. In the case of a pseudoprime, the application also checks if the number is a Carmichael number.
